            <h3>One of the most amazing animals on the planet are bees; they are small, marble-sized, velvety beauty
                that are packed full of pollen. Humming and dipping through your garden or making a high meander
                through an apple tree orchard, they flit from flower to flower,
                sticking their heads between petals in search of pollen and nectar. In this sense, pollination is a
                simple, yet incredibly vital process.</h3>

                <h2>But why Do Bees Matter? </h2>
                <h3>The simplest explanation is that food crops are pollinated by bees. Insects such as
                    bees
                    and other pollinators fertilize plants by moving from one to the next. This process is known as
                    pollination. Bees are covered in tiny hairs that draw pollen to their bodies. Once pollen from a
                    bloom
                    adheres to a bee, it carries the pollen to its next location. Cross-pollination occurs when a bee
                    lands
                    on the next flower or plant and distributes the pollen. It is this process that subsequently
                    produces
                    seeds, fruits, and vegetables. </h3>

            <div class="male-bee">
                <img src="./img/2.png" alt="bee" />
                <h3>
                    Most flowering plants need pollinators in order to proliferate. As was previously said, pollinators
                    are responsible for moving pollen from one bloom to the next in fruits and vegetables. However, bees
                    are useful for more than just producing an endless supply of fruits and vegetables. Nuts, coffee,
                    and even spices are produced by bees.
                </h3>
            </div>
            <div class="female-bee">
                <h3>The top reasons why bees are significant are the following : Bees are indispensable for our food
                    production, contributing to about one-third of what we eat. They also provide half of the world's
                    raw resources, including oils and fabrics. In addition to their vital role in agriculture and
                    industry, bees contribute to the development of medicines. They serve as a food source for wildlife
                    and play a key role in preventing soil erosion, highlighting their essential impact on both
                    ecosystems and human well-being.
                </h3>

                <h3>
                    Can you picture entering your local grocery shop and not seeing food on the shelves? Few fresh
                    fruits
                    and vegetables would be available. Products with honey, almonds, coffee, and chocolate would not
                    exist!
                    There wouldn't even be enough steak or milk. Yes, pollinators like bees are in charge of producing
                    plants like alfalfa that cattle eat. A large proportion of the meals we eat are produced by
                    pollinators.
                    Moreover, pollinators—which include birds, bats, flies, beetles, moths, and more—help keep our
                    planet's
                    lungs healthy. Many trees and other plants benefit from pollinators! They are essential to many
                    ecosystems, making them genuinely keystone species.

            community? </h2>
        <p class="fade-in">T: Promoting a bee-friendly environment involves allowing nature to flourish, avoiding
            excessive spraying, and being aware of the importance of bees for pollination. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="hello" class="scrollText">
        <p class="fade-in">When considering the significance of bees to humans from a distance, the answer becomes
            evident. As a vital component of our food chain, bees also assist the plants that produce the air we
            breathe by acting as pollinators alongside other beneficial insects. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="lilac" class="scrollText">
        <p class="fade-in">We depend on bees and other pollinators every day; they are among the world's most
            significant pollinators for food crops. In actuality, pollination is necessary for two out of every
            three bites we eat. However, the widespread use of pesticides and other environmental variables, such as
            climate change, are contributing to the continued fall in bee populations. The value of bees to
            individuals and the environment at large cannot be overstated. </p>
    </div>


    <div id="lilac" class="scrollText">
        <p class="fade-in">Fact 1 : The temperature in the beehive is maintained year-round by the heating and cooling
            processes within. Since bees have cold blood, they need to maintain a steady temperature in their hive.
            Bees use propolis to seal hive cracks and swarm together to generate body heat to keep the hive warm
            during cold weather. The bees gather water in warm weather and form a circle around the entrance to the
            hive. The bees fan the water with their wings, causing it to evaporate into the air. The chilly air is
            then circulated throughout the hive, acting as a makeshift central air conditioning system. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="rose" class="scrollText">
        <p class="fade-in">Fact 2 : During her lifespan, a queen bee will lay 800,000 eggs! The queen only ever leaves the
            hive to mate once in her life because her entire existence is devoted to procreation. Bees have amazing
            hygiene and pay close attention to detail. They maintain their hive immaculate and groom each other.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="rose" class="scrollText">
        <p class="fade-in">Fact 3 : In our environment, the honeycomb's hexagonal shape is the most efficient shape. The
            arrangement of the cells makes it possible to pack them tightly together without any gaps. The structure
            of the hexagonal cells can support a huge amount of weight despite the thin and delicate nature of the
            wax.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="tulip" class="scrollText">
        <p class="fade-in"> Fact 4 : A bee's primary food sources are pollen and honey. Bees consume honey because it has
            carbohydrates that are high in energy, and they consume pollen because it contains protein that contains
            important amino acids. However, the Queen eats more honey, which contributes to her fertility. The
            queen's main diet consists of a unique concoction of honey and pollen known as "royal jelly." Compared
            to larval jelly, which is what worker and drone bees eat, royal jelly has a higher concentration of
            pollen and honey. The adage "you are what you eat" is particularly applicable in this case because,
            without the additional carbohydrates in royal jelly, the queen would be infertile and resemble smaller
            worker bees.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="tulip" class="scrollText">
        <h2 class="fade-in">What Would Happen If bees disappear? </h2>
        <p class="fade-in">It is impossible to exaggerate the significance of bees. We cannot ignore the fact that
            we would still have some food to eat if the wind didn't contribute to pollination; we would just not
            have any delicious food to eat every day. Pollination of corn and wheat is done by the wind. But most of
            our nutrient-dense food comes from bees. Not one almond, not one apple, not a cherry and the list is
            endless. People would lose their bright, healthful diet. </p>

        <h2 class="fade-in">What happens next?</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Technology could eventually find a way to pollinate "by hand" or with drones. However,
            hand pollination is costly. And where would those expenses end up getting spent? by customers! Fresh
            produce would set you back a great deal of money, even if you could find it. Bee decreases are a sign
            that our course is unfavorable. Since insects form the foundation of our ecosystems, many other species
            are also at risk from the same insecticides that are killing bees. The air and water are also
            contaminated by these harmful substances. They even damage the essential soil communities that we need
            to cultivate our food, remaining in the soil for months or even years. We will be saving a great deal of
            other animals if we take action to conserve the bees. However, we are aware that if we continue to lose
            our bees, we will face more problems than just having to spend 50€ for one orange.</p>
