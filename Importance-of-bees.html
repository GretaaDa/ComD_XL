            Once a bee lands on a flower, pollen from the male reproductive
            organ of the flower clings onto the beeâ€™s hair

        <div class="female-bee">
          <h3>
            When the bee moves to another flower, part of the pollen that was
            stuck to it falls onto the female reproductive organs of the flower,
            pollinating it

            It is an essential part of plant reproduction, and without bees many
            crops essential to humans would not be able to survive

          Flowers produce nectar, a mixture of water and sugars that encourages
          bees to visit them

      <div class="proboscis">
        <img src="./img/6.png" alt="bee" />
        <h3>
          Honeybees are able to use their hollow proboscis (tongue shaped like a
          straw) to draw nectar into one of their two stomachs, the
          proventriculus.There, enzymes break down the nectar, killing bacteria
          turning it into glucose
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="amount-nectar">
        <h3>
          Bees are able to carry up to about half their body weight, meaning a
          single bee may carry around 0.05g of nectar back to the hive in one
          trip. This means that about 50.000 trips are necessary to return 1
          kilogram of nectar to the colony

        <h3>
          At the hive, bees regurgitate the nectar they collected and pass it to
          other worker bees, using their mouth. Doing this breaks down the
          sugars and begins reducing the water content of the nectar
        </h3>

        <h3>
          The bees then fan their wings to further evaporate water, and once it
          reaches about 18%, bacteria and mold can no longer grow, and the honey
          is considered ripe

          Bees then seal the honey in a hexagon shaped honeycomb cell with wax,
          and ready to be harvested
