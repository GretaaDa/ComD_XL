        <h2 class="fade-in">A Beekeeping experience</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Welcome to an insightful interview featuring Torgeir Aarnes, a distinguished Norwegian
            beekeeper, where we delve into the fascinating world of beekeeping and gain valuable insights from his
            expertise.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="decline" class="scrollText">
        <h2 class="fade-in">Q1: How did you get started in beekeeping?</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">T: I had been contemplating beekeeping for quite some time and eventually met someone
            already involved in it. This led to acquaintances with others engaged in beekeeping. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="decline" class="scrollText">
        <h2 class="fade-in">Q2: What type of bees do you keep, and why did you choose that specific species?</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">T: In Innlandet, only one type is allowed, the Carneolian. I also keep Norwegian Brown
            Bees/Buckfast. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="decline" class="scrollText">
        <h2 class="fade-in">Q3: What advice do you have for someone interested in starting their own beehive?</h2>

            community? </h2>
        <p class="fade-in">T: Promoting a bee-friendly environment involves allowing nature to flourish, avoiding
            excessive spraying, and being aware of the importance of bees for pollination. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="hello" class="scrollText">
        <p class="fade-in">When considering the significance of bees to humans from a distance, the answer becomes
            evident. As a vital component of our food chain, bees also assist the plants that produce the air we
            breathe by acting as pollinators alongside other beneficial insects. </p>
    </div>
            <div id="lilac" class="scrollText">
            <h2 class="fade-in">Why Do Bees Matter? </h2>
            <p class="fade-in">The simplest explanation is that food crops are pollinated by bees. Insects such as bees
                and other pollinators fertilize plants by moving from one to the next. This process is known as
                pollination. Bees are covered in tiny hairs that draw pollen to their bodies. Once pollen from a bloom
                adheres to a bee, it carries the pollen to its next location. Cross-pollination occurs when a bee lands
                on the next flower or plant and distributes the pollen. It is this process that subsequently produces
                seeds, fruits, and vegetables. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="lilac" class="scrollText">
            <p class="fade-in">We depend on bees and other pollinators every day; they are among the world's most
                significant pollinators for food crops. In actuality, pollination is necessary for two out of every
                three bites we eat. However, the widespread use of pesticides and other environmental variables, such as
                climate change, are contributing to the continued fall in bee populations. The value of bees to
                individuals and the environment at large cannot be overstated. </p>
        </div>


        <div id="lilac" class="scrollText">
            <p class="fade-in">The temperature in the beehive is maintained year-round by the heating and cooling
                processes within. Since bees have cold blood, they need to maintain a steady temperature in their hive.
                Bees use propolis to seal hive cracks and swarm together to generate body heat to keep the hive warm
                during cold weather. The bees gather water in warm weather and form a circle around the entrance to the
                hive. The bees fan the water with their wings, causing it to evaporate into the air. The chilly air is
                then circulated throughout the hive, acting as a makeshift central air conditioning system. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="rose" class="scrollText">
            <p class="fade-in">During her lifespan, a queen bee will lay 800,000 eggs! The queen only ever leaves the
                hive to mate once in her life because her entire existence is devoted to procreation. Bees have amazing
                hygiene and pay close attention to detail. They maintain their hive immaculate and groom each other.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="rose" class="scrollText">
            <p class="fade-in">In our environment, the honeycomb's hexagonal shape is the most efficient shape. The
                arrangement of the cells makes it possible to pack them tightly together without any gaps. The structure
                of the hexagonal cells can support a huge amount of weight despite the thin and delicate nature of the
                wax.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tulip" class="scrollText">
            <h2 class="fade-in">Fun Fact :</h2>
            <p class="fade-in"> Bees use dance as a form of communication !
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="tulip" class="scrollText">
            <p class="fade-in">A bee's primary food sources are pollen and honey. Bees consume honey because it has
                carbohydrates that are high in energy, and they consume pollen because it contains protein that contains
                important amino acids. However, the Queen eats more honey, which contributes to her fertility. The
                queen's main diet consists of a unique concoction of honey and pollen known as "royal jelly." Compared
                to larval jelly, which is what worker and drone bees eat, royal jelly has a higher concentration of
                pollen and honey. The adage "you are what you eat" is particularly applicable in this case because,
                without the additional carbohydrates in royal jelly, the queen would be infertile and resemble smaller
                worker bees.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tulip" class="scrollText">
            <h2 class="fade-in">What Would Happen If bees disappear? </h2>
            <p class="fade-in">It is impossible to exaggerate the significance of bees. We cannot ignore the fact that
                we would still have some food to eat if the wind didn't contribute to pollination; we would just not
                have any delicious food to eat every day. Pollination of corn and wheat is done by the wind. But most of
                our nutrient-dense food comes from bees. Not one almond, not one apple, not a cherry and the list is
                endless. People would lose their bright, healthful diet. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="tulip" class="scrollText">
            <h2 class="fade-in">What happens next?</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">Technology could eventually find a way to pollinate "by hand" or with drones. However,
                hand pollination is costly. And where would those expenses end up getting spent? by customers! Fresh
                produce would set you back a great deal of money, even if you could find it. Bee decreases are a sign
                that our course is unfavorable. Since insects form the foundation of our ecosystems, many other species
                are also at risk from the same insecticides that are killing bees. The air and water are also
                contaminated by these harmful substances. They even damage the essential soil communities that we need
                to cultivate our food, remaining in the soil for months or even years. We will be saving a great deal of
                other animals if we take action to conserve the bees. However, we are aware that if we continue to lose
                our bees, we will face more problems than just having to spend 50€ for one orange.</p>
