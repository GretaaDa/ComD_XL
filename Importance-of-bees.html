            Once a bee lands on a flower, pollen from the male reproductive
            organ of the flower clings onto the beeâ€™s hair

        <div class="female-bee">
          <h3>
            When the bee moves to another flower, part of the pollen that was
            stuck to it falls onto the female reproductive organs of the flower,
            pollinating it

          Honeybees are able to use their hollow proboscis (tongue shaped like a
          straw) to draw nectar into one of their two stomachs, the
          proventriculus.There, enzymes break down the nectar, killing bacteria
          turning it into glucose
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="amount-nectar">
        <h3>
          Bees are able to carry up to about half their body weight, meaning a
          single bee may carry around 0.05g of nectar back to the hive in one
          trip. This means that about 50.000 trips are necessary to return 1
          kilogram of nectar to the colony

          At the hive, bees regurgitate the nectar they collected and pass it to
          other worker bees, using their mouth. Doing this breaks down the
          sugars and begins reducing the water content of the nectar

          The bees then fan their wings to further evaporate water, and once it

        <h2 class="fade-in">A Beekeeping experience</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Welcome to an insightful interview featuring Torgeir Aarnes, a distinguished Norwegian
            beekeeper, where we delve into the fascinating world of beekeeping and gain valuable insights from his
            expertise.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="decline" class="scrollText">
        <h2 class="fade-in">Q1: How did you get started in beekeeping?</h2>

            already involved in it. This led to acquaintances with others engaged in beekeeping. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="decline" class="scrollText">
        <h2 class="fade-in">Q2: What type of bees do you keep, and why did you choose that specific species?</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">T: In Innlandet, only one type is allowed, the Carneolian. I also keep Norwegian Brown
            Bees/Buckfast. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="decline" class="scrollText">
        <h2 class="fade-in">Q3: What advice do you have for someone interested in starting their own beehive?</h2>
